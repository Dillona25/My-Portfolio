                My Name is Dillon Arnold and Im 21 years old. Born in raised in
                the Portland, Oregon Area but I now currently live in Nebraska
                with my two mini Aussies and wife! On my free time you can find
                me either golfing, coding, golfing or coding. Alongside my
                passion for software development, I also have a passion for
                aviation. I completed 2 years of ground school, 20+ hours of
                simulator flight time and even about 5 hours of real flight
                time. However, I was never able to pass the medical needed to
                pursue a commerical pilot education.
                <br />
                Im a graduate from TripleTen's software engineering bootcamp
                where I found my biggest passion since flying: Software
                development. Ive always been someone who loves to learn, and
                challenege myself and needless to say software developmet
                provides just that. I have a career objective to leverage my
                dedication, passion, and skills in a dynamic environment where I
                can contribute to significant growth, ultimately making an
                impact on a teamâ€™s success!
