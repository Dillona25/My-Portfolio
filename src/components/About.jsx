      {/* My Name is Dillon Arnold and Im 21 years old. Born in raised
                  in the Portland, Oregon Area but I now currently live in
                  Nebraska with my two mini Aussies and wife! On my free time
                  you can find me either golfing, coding, golfing or coding.
                  Alongside my passion for software development, I also have a
                  passion for aviation. I completed 2 years of ground school,
                  20+ hours of simulator flight time and even about 5 hours of
                  real flight time. However, I was never able to pass the
                  medical needed to pursue a commerical pilot education.
                  <br />
                  Im a graduate from TripleTen's software engineering bootcamp
                  where I found my biggest passion since flying: Software
                  development. Ive always been someone who loves to learn, and
                  challenege myself and needless to say software developmet
                  provides just that. I have a career objective to leverage my
                  dedication, passion, and skills in a dynamic environment where
                  I can contribute to significant growth, ultimately making an
                  impact on a teamâ€™s success! */}
